# CLI design checklist

## Help and version

- Provide --help/-h with clear usage, options, and examples; include required parameters in examples.
- Provide --version (use -V); reserve -v for --verbose.

## Input and output

- Support stdin/stdout piping; allow output redirection (e.g., --output for file creation).
- Offer machine-readable output (e.g., --json) when emitting structured data.

## Safety and control

- For modifying/deleting actions, provide --dry-run and an explicit bypass (--yes/--force).
- Provide controllable logging (--quiet, --verbose, or --trace).
- Use deterministic exit codes (0 success, non-zero failure) and avoid silent fallbacks.
- Implement strictly non-interactive modes for CI/CD environments.
- Provide clear, actionable error messages with guidance on how to resolve the issue.

## Security and technical integrity

- Never log, print, or commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive credentials; rigorously protect configuration and environment files.
- Include deterministic verification procedures (e.g., tests, reproduction scripts) to ensure behavioral correctness.

## Configuration

- For JSON configuration, define/update a JSON Schema and validate config on load.
- Support configuration via environment variables for sensitive or environment-specific data.

## Interactive prompts

- Provide required context before asking; for yes/no prompts, Enter means "Yes" and "n" means "No".
